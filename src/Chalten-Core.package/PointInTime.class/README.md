A PointInTime is a representation of certain time entity. This time entities are points in a line, a line that represents the passing time. The observers of that line can zoom in and out the points it contains. When the observer zooms in he sees smaller points (i.e. dates), when the observer zooms out he sees bigger points (i.e. years). We say that the timeline has different scales or that timelines of different scale can represent the passing time.
